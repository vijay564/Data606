In August of 2012, news outlets ranging from the [Washington
Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/poll-shows-atheism-on-the-rise-in-the-us/2012/08/13/90020fd6-e57d-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html) to the [Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/atheism-rise-religiosity-decline-in-america_n_1777031.html)
ran a story about the rise of atheism in America. The source for the story was 
a poll that asked people, "Irrespective of whether you attend a place of 
worship or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious 
person or a convinced atheist?" This type of question, which asks people to 
classify themselves in one way or another, is common in polling and generates 
categorical data. In this lab we take a look at the atheism survey and explore 
what's at play when making inference about population proportions using 
categorical data.

## The survey

To access the press release for the poll, conducted by WIN-Gallup 
International, click on the following link:

*<https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606/blob/master/inst/labs/Lab6/more/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf>*

Take a moment to review the report then address the following questions.

### Exercise 1:  In the first paragraph, several key findings are reported. Do these percentages appear to be *sample     statistics* (derived from the data sample) or *population parameters*?

#### Ans) The percentages are generated from results of the survey which is a sample of the population, so they are       sample statistics.

### Exercise 2:  The title of the report is "Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism". To generalize the report's        findings to the global human population, what must  we assume about the sampling method? Does that seem like a       reasonable assumption?

#### Ans) We must assume that the findings were: random sample from the entire population, the groups are independent      of each other, the sample size should be large enough.

## The data

Turn your attention to Table 6 (pages 15 and 16), which reports the
sample size and response percentages for all 57 countries. While this is
a useful format to summarize the data, we will base our analysis on the
original data set of individual responses to the survey. Load this data
set into R with the following command.

```{r head-data, eval=TRUE}
load("more/atheism.RData")
```

### Exercise 3:  What does each row of Table 6 correspond to? What does each row of `atheism` correspond to?

#### Ans) 
```{r}
head(atheism)
```

#### Each row in table 6 corresponds to results of the survey for each country. Each row of atheism corresponds to        one observation (one individual surveyed).

To investigate the link between these two ways of organizing this data, take a 
look at the estimated proportion of atheists in the United States. Towards 
the bottom of Table 6, we see that this is 5%. We should be able to come to 
the same number using the `atheism` data.

### Exercise 4:  Using the command below, create a new dataframe called `us12` that contains only the rows in            `atheism` associated with respondents to the 2012 survey  from the United States. Next, calculate the proportion      of atheist  responses. Does it agree with the percentage in Table 6? If not, why?

#### Ans) 

```{r us-atheism, eval=TRUE}
us12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "United States" & year == "2012")
```
```{r}
us12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "United States" & year == "2012")
library(plyr)
ath_cnt <- count(us12, "response")
round(ath_cnt$freq[1]/sum(ath_cnt$freq), digits=2)
```
#### I agree with the percentage in table 6.

## Inference on proportions

As was hinted at in Exercise 1, Table 6 provides *statistics*, that is, 
calculations made from the sample of 51,927 people. What we'd like, though, is 
insight into the population *parameters*. You answer the question, "What 
proportion of people in your sample reported being atheists?" with a 
statistic; while the question "What proportion of people on earth would report 
being atheists" is answered with an estimate of the parameter.

The inferential tools for estimating population proportion are analogous to 
those used for means in the last chapter: the confidence interval and the 
hypothesis test.

### Exercise 5.  Write out the conditions for inference to construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of     atheists in the United States in 2012.Are you confident all conditions are met?

#### Ans) The conditions to create an inference are that the sample observations are independent and if each              proportion to be sufficiently large, so np > 10 and n(1-p) > 10. There are 50 atheists and 952 non-atheists.         Both conditions are satisfied. 

If the conditions for inference are reasonable, we can either calculate
the standard error and construct the interval by hand, or allow the `inference`
function to do it for us.

```{r us-atheism-ci, eval=TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
inference(us12$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", 
          success = "atheist")
```

Note that since the goal is to construct an interval estimate for a 
proportion, it's necessary to specify what constitutes a "success", which here 
is a response of `"atheist"`.

Although formal confidence intervals and hypothesis tests don't show up in the 
report, suggestions of inference appear at the bottom of page 7: "In general, 
the error margin for surveys of this kind is $\pm$ 3-5% at 95% confidence".

### Exercise 6:  Based on the R output, what is the margin of error for the estimate of the  proportion of the           proportion of atheists in US in 2012?

#### Ans)
```{r}
z <- 1.96
SE <- 0.0069
(ME <- z * SE)

```

#### The margin of error for US is 0.013.

### Exercise 7:  Using the `inference` function, calculate confidence intervals for the proportion of atheists in        2012 in two other countries of your choice, and  report the associated margins of error. Be sure to note whether     the conditions for inference are met. It may be helpful to create new data  sets for each of the two countries       first, and then use these data sets in  the `inference` function to construct the confidence intervals.

#### Ans)
```{r}
# France
fr12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "France" & year == "2012")
ath_cnt <- count(fr12, "response")
round(ath_cnt$freq[1]/sum(ath_cnt$freq), digits=2)
# Japan
jp12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "Japan" & year == "2012")
ath_cnt <- count(jp12, "response")
round(ath_cnt$freq[1]/sum(ath_cnt$freq), digits=2)
#onfidence intervals of 2 countries
inference(fr12$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
inference(jp12$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
```

#### Margin of Error - France = Confidence level (at 95%) Z* X SE = 1.960.011 = 0.0215
#### Margin of Error - Japan = Confidence level (at 95%) Z X SE = 1.96*0.0132 = 0.0258

## How does the proportion affect the margin of error?

Imagine you've set out to survey 1000 people on two questions: are you female? 
and are you left-handed? Since both of these sample proportions were 
calculated from the same sample size, they should have the same margin of 
error, right? Wrong! While the margin of error does change with sample size, 
it is also affected by the proportion.

Think back to the formula for the standard error: $SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. This 
is then used in the formula for the margin of error for a 95% confidence 
interval: $ME = 1.96\times SE = 1.96\times\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. Since the 
population proportion $p$ is in this $ME$ formula, it should make sense that 
the margin of error is in some way dependent on the population proportion. We 
can visualize this relationship by creating a plot of $ME$ vs. $p$.

The first step is to make a vector `p` that is a sequence from 0 to 1 with 
each number separated by 0.01. We can then create a vector of the margin of 
error (`me`) associated with each of these values of `p` using the familiar 
approximate formula ($ME = 2 \times SE$). Lastly, we plot the two vectors 
against each other to reveal their relationship.

```{r me-plot, eval=TRUE}
n <- 1000
p <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)
me <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
plot(me ~ p, ylab = "Margin of Error", xlab = "Population Proportion")
```

### Exercise 8:  Describe the relationship between `p` and `me`.

#### Ans) This relationship appears to have a maximum when p = 0.5, and a minimum when p = 0 or 1. This curve appears      to like a parabola with a max at 0.5. When you start to go further away from 0.5 in each direction, the margin       of error starts to decrease.

## Success-failure condition

The textbook emphasizes that you must always check conditions before making 
inference. For inference on proportions, the sample proportion can be assumed 
to be nearly normal if it is based upon a random sample of independent 
observations and if both $np \geq 10$ and $n(1 - p) \geq 10$. This rule of 
thumb is easy enough to follow, but it makes one wonder: what's so special 
about the number 10?

The short answer is: nothing. You could argue that we would be fine with 9 or 
that we really should be using 11. What is the "best" value for such a rule of 
thumb is, at least to some degree, arbitrary. However, when $np$ and $n(1-p)$ 
reaches 10 the sampling distribution is sufficiently normal to use confidence 
intervals and hypothesis tests that are based on that approximation.

We can investigate the interplay between $n$ and $p$ and the shape of the 
sampling distribution by using simulations. To start off, we simulate the 
process of drawing 5000 samples of size 1040 from a population with a true 
atheist proportion of 0.1. For each of the 5000 samples we compute $\hat{p}$ 
and then plot a histogram to visualize their distribution.

```{r sim-np, eval=TRUE}
p <- 0.1
n <- 1040
p_hats <- rep(0, 5000)

for(i in 1:5000){
  samp <- sample(c("atheist", "non_atheist"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p, 1-p))
  p_hats[i] <- sum(samp == "atheist")/n
}

hist(p_hats, main = "p = 0.1, n = 1040", xlim = c(0, 0.18))
```

These commands build up the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ using the 
familiar `for` loop. You can read the sampling procedure for the first line of 
code inside the `for` loop as, "take a sample of size $n$ with replacement 
from the choices of atheist and non-atheist with probabilities $p$ and $1 - p$,
respectively." The second line in the loop says, "calculate the proportion of 
atheists in this sample and record this value." The loop allows us to repeat 
this process 5,000 times to build a good representation of the sampling 
distribution.

### Exercise 9:  Describe the sampling distribution of sample proportions at $n = 1040$ and  $p = 0.1$. Be sure to       note the center, spread, and shape.\*Hint:* Remember that R has functions such as `mean` to calculate summary        statistics.

#### Ans) 
```{r}
qqnorm(p_hats)
```

#### The mean is 0.1. It has a 0.04 skew. SD of 0.01. It appears to have a normal distribution. The spread (from 1st      quartile to 3rd quartile) is from 0.9327 to .10580.

### Exercise 10: Repeat the above simulation three more times but with modified sample sizes and proportions: for $n     = 400$ and $p = 0.1$, $n = 1040$ and  $p = 0.02$, and $n = 400$ and $p = 0.02$. Plot all four histograms together     by running the `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` command before creating the histograms. You may need to expand the plot        window to accommodate the larger two-by-two plot. Describe the three new sampling distributions. Based on these      limited plots, how does $n$ appear to affect the distribution of $\hat{p}$? How does $p$ affect the sampling         distribution?

#### Ans)

```{r}
samp_func <- function (p, n) { 
  p_hats <- rep(0, 5000)
  for(i in 1:5000){
    samp <- sample(c("atheist", "non_atheist"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p, 1-p))
    p_hats[i] <- sum(samp == "atheist")/n
  }
  p_hats
}
p_hats1 <- samp_func(.1, 400)
p_hats2 <- samp_func(.02, 1040)
p_hats3 <- samp_func(.02, 400)


par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

hist(p_hats1, main = "p = 0.1, n = 400", xlim = c(0, 0.18))
hist(p_hats2, main = "p = 0.02, n = 1040", xlim = c(0, .06))
hist(p_hats3, main = "p = 0.02, n = 400", xlim = c(0, .06))
     

```

Once you're done, you can reset the layout of the plotting window by using the 
command `par(mfrow = c(1, 1))` command or clicking on "Clear All" above the 
plotting window (if using RStudio). Note that the latter will get rid of all 
your previous plots.

### Exercise 11: If you refer to Table 6, you'll find that Australia has a sample  proportion of 0.1 on a sample size     of 1040, and that Ecuador has a sample proportion of 0.02 on 400 subjects. Let's suppose for this exercise that      these point estimates are actually the truth. Then given the shape of their respective sampling distributions, do     you think it is sensible to proceed with inference and report margin of errors, as the reports does?

#### Ans) Both seem to have a normal distribution (symmetric) and have independent observations. the problem comes        with Ecuador as the proportion is 0.02x400 = 8, which is less than the condition of 10. With Australia, we can       proceed as the sample meets all the conditions (0.1x1040=104).

## On your own

The question of atheism was asked by WIN-Gallup International in a similar 
survey that was conducted in 2005. (We assume here that sample sizes have 
remained the same.) Table 4 on page 13 of the report summarizes survey results 
from 2005 and 2012 for 39 countries.

### 1) Answer the following two questions using the `inference` function. As  always, write out the hypotheses for       any tests you conduct and outline the status of the conditions for inference.

### a) Is there convincing evidence that Spain has seen a change in its  atheism index between 2005 and 2012?\           *Hint:* Create a new data set for respondents from Spain. Form confidence intervals for the true proportion of       athiests in both years, and determine whether they overlap.

#### Ans)H0: Atheism_change_2005_2012 = 0 (P05 = P12 = 0.1),
####     HA: Atheism_change_2005_2012 != 0 (P12 != 0.1)Observations are independent and the proportions of                    atheist/non-atheist are greater than 10, therefore, the sampling distribution is nearly normal
```{r}
sp05 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "Spain" & year == "2005")
count(sp05, "response")
sp12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "Spain" & year == "2012")
count(sp12, "response")

inference(sp05$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
inference(sp12$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
```

#### The confidence intervals for sp05 and sp12 overlap, and the p_hat values differ by 0.01. Therefore H0 cannot be      rejected, there is no convincing evidence that Spain has seen a change in its atheism index from 2005 and 2012

### b) Is there convincing evidence that the United States has seen a change in its atheism index between 2005 and       2012?

#### Ans)H0: Atheism_change_2005_2012 = 0 (P05 = P12 = 0.01),
####     HA: Atheism_change_2005_2012 != 0 (P12 != 0.01) Observations are independent and the proportions of                  atheist/non-atheist are greater or equal than 10, therefore, the sampling distribution is nearly normal.
```{r}
#United States
us05 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "United States" & year == "2005")
count(us05, "response")
us12 <- subset(atheism, nationality == "United States" & year == "2012")
count(us12, "response")
#confidence interval
inference(us05$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
inference(us12$response, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "atheist")
```

#### The confidence intervals for us05 and us12 do not overlap, and the p_hat values differ by 0.04. Therefore H0 can       be rejected, there is convincing evidence that US has seen a change in its atheism index from 2005 and 2012

### 2) If in fact there has been no change in the atheism index in the countries listed in Table 4, in how many of       those countries would you expect to detect a change (at a significance level of 0.05) simply by chance?\*Hint:*      Look in the textbook index under Type 1 error.

#### Ans) Type I Error, rejecting the null hypothesis even though is true, in this case, no change in atheism index.       At 0.05 significance level, we will make a Type I error no more than 5% of the time, so, out of 39 countries,        we may fail in 2 (39*0.05)

### 3)  Suppose you're hired by the local government to estimate the proportion of  residents that attend a religious    service on a weekly basis. According to  the guidelines, the estimate must have a margin of error no greater than    1% with 95% confidence. You have no idea what to expect for $p$. How many  people would you have to sample to        ensure that you are within the guidelines?\*Hint:* Refer to your plot of the relationship between $p$ and margin     of error. Do not use the data set to answer this question.

#### Ans) ME=0.01, then SE=0.01/1.96 (at 95% conf. level)= 0.0051
#### Since p is unknown, we use the 0.5 as the worst case value where the ME is the largest.
#### From the SE formula: SE=sqrt(p(1-p)/n),we can determine n
#### n = (0.5*(1-0.5))/(0.0051)^2 = 9612 people (at least)
